Steps:
	-> Take image
	-> crop to box(which has text in it)
	-> convert into gray scale(mono crome)
	-> give to tesseract
	-> text(output of tesseract)
Now we will process this text means we will get meaningful information from it.
	-> find name using name database
	-> find father's name(assuming that second will be father's name)
	-> find year of birth
	-> find for PAN
